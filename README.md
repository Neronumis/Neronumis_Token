What is Neronumis?

Nerinumis (NERO) token serves as a share for the trading pool.
For each NERO, one USDC is produced which is used as a share for the trading pool.
When you swap NERO for USDC, the NERO used for the swap will be burned.
Thus, only NERO are in circulation which are used for the trading pool.

How much does a NERO cost?

The price of one NERO increases every month fixed by 3%.
You can always see the current price on our website or directly when exchanging NERO/USDC

---

Are losses possible?

No, the price increase of one NERO is fixed at 3% and we buy and sell the tokens at any time at a fixed price via decentralised exchanges such as Uniswap.
If the token is listed on central exchanges and achieves a higher or lower value there, we still buy and sell the tokens decentrally at a fixed price.
However, this should cause the price on the central exchanges to adjust to ours.

How are the profits achieved?

Our team consists of several professional traders who monitor the crypto market 24/7 and manage the trading pool for you.
The trading pool consists of the investments that are generated by the exchange of NERO, these are combined in a pool, this then acts as a trading pool.
Experience shows that we generate 4â€“7% per month and can thus guarantee the fixed 3%.
The surplus goes to the traders and the company Neronumis Ltd.
